# TuneZilla

A simplistic lyric-fetching web app that optionally provides background and historical information about your favorite songs.

## Motivation

We wanted a website that can easily serve our favorite songs to sing and shout while also learning more about the song without having to open a boring Wikipedia page.

## Recommended Usage

Due to the limitations of some API's available, some results may vary based on the song inputted. For example, it is a known issue that there may not be any available background information on some newer or lesser-known songs. **For testing purposes, we recommend you test our web app with Justin Bieber's "Love Yourself."**
